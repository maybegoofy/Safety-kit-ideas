3 stages of safety system
L1 - audio, it beeps at you to alert you to pay attention
L2 - OBD2, for drive by wire cars it can tell the car to hit the brakes in an emergency (or hit the gas for ACC) and can nudge the car back into the lane (with electric power steering) 
L3 - integrated into the car, possibly replacing the ECU, and adding a bunch of sensors

All stages would collect data(gps data, dashcam video, etc) and with a cellular connection(possibly with a subscription)  could relay that to a phone app or possibly call EMS in the event of an accident or things like that. All stages would also use a dashcam and a ML model to make decisions/alerts
