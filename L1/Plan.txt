Possibly an android app? 

possiby Kotlin front end with a python back end? https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/top-programming-languages-for-android-app-development/
all python? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWKYJU0MGY0

possibly use this ^^^
or at least base it on that

Goals(primary):
    • Front collision
    • Runs on a mobile device
Goals(secondary):
    • Lane detection
    • Video Recording
    • GPS Data and reporting (life360 esque)
    • EMS contacting
        • Possibly in the event of a detected emergency (accelerometer?)

Option 1: (current plan, probably harder, but more versitile)
Create a ML/AI model(possibly based on the github linked above) to preform analysis

Option 2: (backup? probably easier, less versitile)
Basic analysis(if statements based)

Option 3:(hybrid? hardest, most reliable?)
Some combination of the two
